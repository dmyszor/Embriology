Use images of oocytes in png format
Preferred oocyte image size 550 x 550 px

Extract deepLabV3Plus_193_2.zip.001 (GitHub 25 MB limitation)

The process for oocyte type determination has two phases:
1. Mask generation
2. Oocyte type determination

The purpose of the mask generation phase is the generation of intermediary files that hold information about extracted components of oocytes required in order to determine oocyte type. To obtain intermediary files, a Python interpreter is needed. Modify the content of SegmentationModles/EmbrioGenerateSingleMaskDeepLabV3PlusStep1.py. Set:
FOLDER_WITH_NETWORK - folder which contains deepLabV3Plus_193.zip file, in this directory MasksGeneratedByTheNetwork folder will be created, it will hold intermediary files;
INPUT_IMAGE_PATH - path to the oocyte png file.
Then run the script.

To classify oocytes use Matlab, and modify DataAnalysis_EvaluateNetworkDataSingleFileStep2.m file. Set 
networkPath - path to the classification network (10 network is provided, and each consecutive version was obtained during separate run of SSRS process)
sourceCSVDatasetFolder - location of intermediary files generated by segmentation process

Run the mat file. Information about oocyte type will appear on the screen.
